# New Limaru Website

## About
This is the repository of the new Limaru City Server Website. Pull requests are welcome! The site will be built using node.js and HTML. At the moment HTML pages are being added and work on the node.js component has not started yet.

## Why a new website?
[The existing website](https://mineshafter61.github.io/LimaruSite/index.html) had a lack of regular maintenance since the code had fallen into the point where no one on the server knew what portions of the code did what. Thus, Mineshafter61 got to work creating the repository for the new site and it was decided to use node.js instead of Flask for the website, as node.js, which uses Javascript, is more suitable for the web than Flask, which is apparently quite buggy and uses Python, which is not the best choice for the web.

## How long before this new website is finished?
It's still too early to tell, but you can [track our progress through the projects panel of this repository.](https://github.com/Mineshafter61/NewLimaruSite/projects)
